      <description>Introduction I will also put an &amp;ldquo;out of 5&amp;rdquo; rating for each enhancements. Keep in mind, this is not an absolute measure of the enhancement&amp;rsquo;s strength, but rather how useful I find it throughout all levels of play. For example, Penitence can be boring and weak, but it can be gamechanging for certain ultra fights. Praxis deals really high damage, but there are not many scenarios where you couldn&amp;rsquo;t clear some content without Praxis.</description>

      <description>Introduction Chronomancers, also known as Calendar classes, can be obtained for 6000 ACs or 5 HeroPoints at /join heromart. Alternatively, you can physically order the more recent calendars and get a code alongside them to unlock the class.
Calendar classes are known for their Rift Collapse mechanic, which lets them take the damage they&amp;rsquo;ve dealt in the last 10 seconds, multiply it by some factor, and deal it all again in one huge crit: a nuke.</description>

      <description>Introduction Alright, this guide will be pointlessly complicated AND pointlessly specific.
Are you in the 1% of players that care about a difference between 22k and 24k DPS when farming on ArchMage?
And if you are, do you happen to be in the other 1% to have wasted $100 on Acheron?
Mechanics Acheron Acheron, when used, applies a DoT to the user. This stacks up to 30x for about ~1500, depending on the active buffs.</description>

      <description>Anthea stood outside the restaurant, her gaze fixed on the entrance as she waited patiently for her friends to settle the bill. She hated the strife between her two closest friends and her partner Nolan. Sure, she has his flaws, but why can&amp;rsquo;t they just accept him?
The soft glow of the evening lights bathed her in a warm ambiance, creating an atmosphere of calm anticipation. As she leaned against the brick wall, her body language exuded a sense of subtle vulnerability.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I canâ€™t believe Nolan forgot again. Why do you even stay with him?&amp;rdquo;
19-year-old Anthea&amp;rsquo;s eyes darted around the table, her smile fading as her friend&amp;rsquo;s words sank in. She fidgeted with her napkin, unable to meet anyone&amp;rsquo;s gaze.
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be so harsh on him.&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s dealing with a lot of stress right now.&amp;rdquo;
Anthea stared down her own lap, ignoring the waiter as he placed her birthday cake in front of her.</description>

      <description>Introduction Tyndarius, the Avatar of Fire at /join ultratyndarius is a good entry-level Ultra and the first one I&amp;rsquo;d recommend clearing after the three in TimeInn. His Insignias offer Infernal Flame Pyromancer, an armor with a 25% boost to all rewards and 35% to damage. Infernal Flame Khopesh, also from Tyndarius, offerst the best damage boost to Elementals. Clearing Tyndarius also unlocks further endgame content.
Worth mentioning that Tyndarius is a daily Ultra, not a weekly one.</description>

      <description>Introduction Malgor, The First Speaker at /join ultraspeaker is currently the most complicated, but also most rewarding Ultra to beat.
His Insignias offer Radiant Goddess of War, the best-in-slot boost armor for all situations. Most players tend to get Dauntless first though, because of how overpowered that enhancement is on some classes.
Spoiler: Main Story, Malgor Questline Malgor is called a Speaker, because he speaks. A Speaker is a more evolved form of a Mumbler, one of these:</description>
