		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This article will explain how boosting items work in Adventure Quest Worlds.
In particular, we will look into the interaction between the following boosts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>XP/CP/Gold/REP</strong> boosts</li>
<li><strong>Damage to All</strong> like <abbr title="Necrotic Sword of Doom">NSoD</abbr></li>
<li><strong>Damage to Races</strong> like Polly Roger</li>
<li>The <strong>All Out</strong> stat</li>
</ul>
<p>To find your current boosts, look for the following icons on your stat panel:</p>
<p><img src="/img/aqw/statspanelboost.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>I will be linking items as examples, but many of them have alternatives and variants.
This article is meant to be an explanation, not a comprehensive list.</p>

<h1 id="additive-vs-multiplicative">Additive vs. Multiplicative</h1>
<details open>
    <summary>Basic Explanation (feel free to skip)</summary>
<p>One thing that&rsquo;s important to understand is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">100%</span> is the same as the number <span style="text-decoration: underline;">1</span>.
The per<strong>cent</strong> sign is just an indication of &ldquo;one hundredth&rdquo;, the same &ldquo;cent&rdquo; as in a penny.</p>
<p>Eating 50% of an icecream is the same as eating half of it, (0.5), and doubling your salary means you earn 200% as much as you used to.</p>
<p>Similarly, there&rsquo;s no difference between adding 20% to something, and multiplying it by 120%. Or 1.2.</p>
</details>
<p>Suppose you have Exalted Apotheosis boosting your damage by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">51%</span> and Polly Roger giving you a further <span style="text-decoration: underline;">30%</span> against the monster you&rsquo;re fighting.
You might think that you have an 81% damage boost, but that&rsquo;s not the case.</p>
<p>By the time Polly&rsquo;s 30% is applied, you&rsquo;re not supposed to add the 30% of your original damage, but 30% of your damage <em>after</em> accounting for Apotheosis.
This results in a slightly higher number.</p>
<p>To calculate multiplicative boost, you&hellip; multiply the total values together.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">151%*130%=195%</span></p>
<p>In other words, you get a 95% boost, not an 81% one. Multiplicative boosts are more effective when going up.</p>
<p>In general:</p>
<ul>
<li>boosts within the All Out stat stack <strong>additively</strong></li>
<li>boosts within the same category do not stack, instead you get the <strong>highest value you have equipped</strong>
<ul>
<li>boosts within the Damage to All items don&rsquo;t stack</li>
<li>XP/CP/Gold/REP boosts also don&rsquo;t stack
<ul>
<li>but you can equip different items for each. For example you might have a cape boosting your REP and an armor boosting your Gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>boosts within the Damage to Races items also don&rsquo;t stack
<ul>
<li>same as above. You might have an armor that gives +50% to dragons, and a weapon that deals +75% to Undead</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the boosts from the above three damage categories stack <strong>multiplicatively</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="xpcpgoldrep">XP/CP/Gold/REP</h1>
<p>These four are fairly easy to explain because they don&rsquo;t interact with the combat boosts.
If you have an item boosting these, you will gain increased rewards from killing monsters and turning in quests.</p>
<p>You can also use a consumable boost to double your rewards. These stack <strong>multiplicatively</strong> with the item boost.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there&rsquo;s a server-wide doubling of your rewards. These also stack <strong>multiplicatively</strong>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of some, but not all of the important items to look at:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/cape-of-awe">Cape of Awe</a> +25%, relatively easy to get</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/archfiend-doomlord">ArchFiend DoomLord</a> and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/infernal-flame-pyromancer">Infernal Flame Pyromancer</a> +25%, same as above with an additional damage boost</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/empowered-bonfire-altar">Empowered Bonfire Altar</a> and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/nightmare-carnax-s-guardians">Nightmare Carnax&rsquo;s Guardians</a> +25%, same as AFDL except in the cape slot</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/head-of-the-legion-beast">Head of the Legion Beast</a> +30%</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/drago-s-royal-guard">Drago&rsquo;s Royal Guard</a> +35% CP and XP</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/kala-s-living-head">Kala&rsquo;s Living Head </a> and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/iara-s-acolyte">Iara&rsquo;s Acolyte </a> +30%, seasonal</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/awescended">Awescended</a> +30% gold, +50% CP and REP, no XP</li>
</ul>
<p>With an Awescended set piece, a CP or REP boost item, and a server-wide boost, the highest bonus you can achieve is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">150%*200%*200</span> for a total multiplier or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">600%</span>, which is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">500%</span> bonus compared to your base rate.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re max level, XP boosts are irrelevant to you.
CP and REP might be relevant based on what you&rsquo;re doing, and Gold is generally always useful.
If you do need XP, consider the Legion Beast helm or Dragon&rsquo;s Guard over, or in addition to, Awescended.</p>
<p>Therefore the best-in-slot item is <strong>Awescended</strong> or other items with the same boosts.</p>
<h1 id="damage-to-all-items">Damage to All Items</h1>
<p>Some weapons increase your damage.
Here are the most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/burning-blade-2">Burning Blade</a> +15%</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/burning-blade-of-abezeth">Burning Blade of Abezeth</a> +30%</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/exalted-apotheosis">Exalted Apotheosis</a> +51%</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necrotic-sword-of-doom-sword">Necrotic Sword of Doom</a> +51%</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/apothe.gif"
    alt="As we can see, our friend hits for 604 damage per strike.
This is exactly what we&amp;rsquo;d expect by multiplying his base 400 hit by the 151% of Apotheosis."><figcaption>
      <h4>Apotheosis = 604</h4><p>As we can see, our friend hits for 604 damage per strike.<br>This is exactly what we&rsquo;d expect by multiplying his base 400 hit by the 151% of Apotheosis.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Many of these have reskins and dual-wield alternatives.
This is good because you can use different Enhancements on them.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning that you don&rsquo;t have to get this boost from weapons:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dalang-sinden">Dalang Sinden</a> +25%</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/archfiend-doomlord">ArchFiend DoomLord</a> and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/infernal-flame-pyromancer">Infernal Flame Pyromancer</a> +35%</li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/empowered-bonfire-altar">Empowered Bonfire Altar</a> and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/nightmare-carnax-s-guardians">Nightmare Carnax&rsquo;s Guardians</a> +35%, same as AFDL, except in the cape slot</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/afdl.gif"
    alt="Same calculation as before, just with a lower number. AFDL with its 35% boost results in 540 total damage.
"><figcaption>
      <h4>AFDL = 540</h4><p>Same calculation as before, just with a lower number. AFDL with its 35% boost results in 540 total damage.<br></p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As mentioned earlier, boosts <em>within the same category</em> don&rsquo;t stack, meaning if you&rsquo;re using <abbr title="ArchFiend DoomLord">AFDL</abbr>, then Burning Blade (of Abezeth) is useless to you.
Apotheosis and NSoD, in turn, override your AFDL&rsquo;s damage boost with a higher one.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/afdl%20apothe.gif"
    alt="Our friend is displaying the fact that same-type boosts don&amp;rsquo;t stack
The higher value of Apotheosis simply overrides AFDL&amp;rsquo;s boost."><figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth mentioning, that this form of boost also <span style="text-decoration: underline;">increases your healing</span>, not just your damage.
However, self-damage (for example Necromancer&rsquo;s) is also increased.</p>
<p>The best-in-slot item is <strong>Necrotic Sword of Doom</strong> and variants.</p>
<h1 id="damage-to-races-items">Damage to Races Items</h1>
<p>There are 7 races in the game, 5 of which are relevant: <strong>Undead, Dragon, Human, Elemental, Chaos</strong>, Drakath, and Orc.
Yes, Drakath is his own race.
You can find out a monster&rsquo;s race by enabling the option to see them and looking under their name.</p>
<p><img src="/img/aqw/showmonstertype.png" alt="Alt text">
<img src="/img/aqw/showmonstertype2.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>There are weapons that give a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">75%</span> boost to specific races:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undead: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/blinding-light-of-destiny-axe">Blinding Light of Destiny</a></li>
<li>Dragon: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dragonblade-of-nulgath">DragonBlade of Nulgath</a> (requires membership) and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/dark-dragon-slayer-s-halberd">Dark Dragon Slayer&rsquo;s Halberd </a></li>
<li>Human: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/prince-darkon-s-poleaxe">Prince Darkon&rsquo;s Poleaxe </a> and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/nightmare-carnax-s-battleaxe">Nightmare Carnax&rsquo;s BattleAxe</a></li>
<li>Elemental: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/infernal-flame-khopesh">Infernal Flame Khopesh</a></li>
<li>Chaos: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/empowered-blade-of-chaos">Empowered Blade of Chaos</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also worth mentioning that the highest damage boost is offered for a race with only a handful of monsters in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/chaorrupter-unlocked-ac">Chaorrupter Unlocked</a> 120% to Drakath</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also armors that offer a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">50%</span> boost to their respective races.
This is lower than the 75% of weapons, but they don&rsquo;t take up your weapon slot, meaning you can combine them with NSoD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Undead: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/empowered-undead-champion">Empowered Undead Champion</a></li>
<li>Dragon: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/fire-champion-s-armor">Fire Champion&rsquo;s Armor</a></li>
<li>Human: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/sepulchure-s-doomknight-armor">Sepulchure&rsquo;s DoomKnight Armor </a> (51%, member) and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/void-beetle-warlord">Void Beetle Warlord</a></li>
<li>Elemental: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/malgor-the-shadowlord">Malgor the ShadowLord</a></li>
<li>Chaos: <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/empowered-drakath-armor">Empowered Drakath Armor</a> and <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/hollowborn-envoy-of-chaos">Hollowborn Envoy of Chaos</a></li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/champion.gif"
    alt="Frostval Barbarian is kind and helpful, but he does prefer simpler numbers.
Adding 50% to 400 is a simple operation he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mind calculating."><figcaption>
      <h4>Fire Champion = 600</h4><p>Frostval Barbarian is kind and helpful, but he does prefer simpler numbers.<br>Adding 50% to 400 is a simple operation he doesn&rsquo;t mind calculating.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, there are items that give only a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">30%</span> boost, but they give it to <strong>all</strong> races instead of just one:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/archfiend-deathlord">Archfiend DeathLord</a></li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/polly-roger">Polly Roger</a>, a pet</li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/polly.gif"
    alt="He has found a friend!
Polly Roger increases his base damage by 30% against all monsters that have a race."><figcaption>
      <h4>Polly = 520</h4><p>He has found a friend!<br>Polly Roger increases his base damage by 30% against all monsters that have a race.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each ratial boost is treated as its own category.
Boosts against the same race can&rsquo;t stack, but they can coexist with boosts to other races.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/polly%20champion.gif"
    alt="One more case of the higher boost overriding the lower one.

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h1 id="all-out">All Out</h1>
<p>All Out, also known as &ldquo;Damage Boost&rdquo; acts in the same way as NSoD does, but comes from different sources.</p>
<p>It appears in the stat panel as a secondary stat.</p>
<p><img src="/img/aqw/allout.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>Notable, class-independent sources of an All Out boost are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/forge-cape-enhancements">Vainglory</a></li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/forge-weapon-enhancements">Elysium</a></li>
<li><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/potent-honor-potion">Honor Potions</a></li>
</ul>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/honor.gif"
    alt="As usual, we add the 75% boost from the Potent Honor Potion to our base 400 damage.
400*175%=700."><figcaption>
      <h4>Potent Honor = 700</h4><p>As usual, we add the 75% boost from the Potent Honor Potion to our base 400 damage.<br>400*175%=700.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h1 id="ideal-setup">Ideal Setup</h1>
<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s make a calculation. Is it better to use an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All-boost Weapon and a Racial Armor</span>, or a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Racial Armor and an All-boost weapon</span>?</p>
<p>Assuming the player is fighting Dragons, DragonBlade of Nulgath and ArchFiend DoomLoord give a total damage of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">175% * 135% = <strong>236%</strong></span></p>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/chaossword.gif"
    alt="A weapon with a 75% boost, and an armor with 35%.
That should be 236% of 400, which is 945."><figcaption>
      <h4>Chaos Greatsword = 945</h4><p>A weapon with a 75% boost, and an armor with 35%.<br>That should be 236% of 400, which is 945.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The alternative, NSoD and Fire Champion&rsquo;s Armor results in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">151% * 150% = <strong>226%</strong></span></p>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/champion%20apothe.gif"
    alt="The calculations match the observations!
Fire Champion&amp;rsquo;s 50% and Apotheosis&amp;rsquo; 51% multiply together to 226% total damage."><figcaption>
      <h4>Fire Champion &#43; Apotheosis = 906</h4><p>The calculations match the observations!<br>Fire Champion&rsquo;s 50% and Apotheosis&rsquo; 51% multiply together to 226% total damage.</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As we can see, using the weapon associated with the given race results in marginally more damage.</p>
<p>However, having NSoD active deals significantly more damage to all races other than dragons, including monsters without a race.
It also results in higher healing.</p>
<p>When accounting for the time to switch between items, and the difficulty of acquiring each item, NSoD and Polly Roger is a very common combination that does well in all situations. NSoD and Exalted Apotheosis have plenty of variants for different Enhancements, and Polly Roger, being a pet, doesn&rsquo;t need to be enhanced at all.</p>
<p>From a setup like this, we can optionally switch to an racial armor to increase our boost from 30% to 50%.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we can replace the NSoD with a racial weapon if we only care about damage and we don&rsquo;t mind the inconvenience. In this case, it&rsquo;s good to have an AFDL or equivalent equipped so that we retain a solid All-boost.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/aqw/boostgifs/all.gif"
    alt="151%*150%*175% = 3.96
The math checks out. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of damage!"><figcaption>
      <h4>Combined</h4><p>151%*150%*175% = 3.96<br>The math checks out. That&rsquo;s a lot of damage!</p>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For both of these, we want to have an Awescended set item or equivalent for the constantly on reward boost.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to make sure we have enough combinations of such items that we can use a variety of enhancements according to our class and situation.</p>
<h1 id="radiant-goddess">Radiant Goddess</h1>
<p>I left the best for last.
As it turns out, <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/radiant-goddess-of-war">Radiant Goddess of War</a> combines the Awescended boost to rewards with a 50% boost against all 5 races in one armor-slot item that doesn&rsquo;t need enhancements<a href="/img/aqw/peakperformance2.png">.</a></p>
