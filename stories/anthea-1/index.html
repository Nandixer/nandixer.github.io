		<p>&ldquo;I canâ€™t believe Nolan forgot <em>again</em>. Why do you even stay with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>19-year-old Anthea&rsquo;s eyes darted around the table, her smile fading as her friend&rsquo;s words sank in.
She fidgeted with her napkin, unable to meet anyone&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so harsh on him.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dealing with a lot of stress right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthea stared down her own lap, ignoring the waiter as he placed her birthday cake in front of her.
The restaurant was quiet, giving the three girls plenty of opportunities to banter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;m <em>sure</em>.&rdquo; her other friend added sarcastically. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably why he spent 41 hours gaming last week alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ShadowMecha Suit was a limited drop!&rdquo; Anthea raised her pitch. &ldquo;And stop stalking his profile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl put away her phone.
Sarah, a long time friend of Anthea and the popular girl of the group used to play video games, and she has Nolan on her friends&rsquo; list.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about we stop making Anthy&rsquo;s day worse?&rdquo; Chloe, the quiet girl added. &ldquo;Try your cake! We both pitched in, so hope you enjoy it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthea&rsquo;s eyes turned towards her slice.
They&rsquo;re all college students, and can&rsquo;t exactly afford to eat out often.
The initiative of her friends would have surely brought a smile to her face, had it not been for the constant strife between them and her boyfriend.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not like Nolan always neglects her, she thought.
If she had really cared about her birthday, she could have clearly communicated this to him and he would have stepped up.
Surely.</p>
<p>Besides, what&rsquo;s so wrong with having a gamer boyfriend?
It&rsquo;s not like other guys don&rsquo;t have hobbies.
He never shouts at her, doesn&rsquo;t flirt with other girls, and occasionally even cooks.</p>
<p>She dug her fork into the cake, slicing through the soft treat.
Cream chocolate flowed out onto her plate.
She stared intently at her food in an attempt to avoid her friends&rsquo; gaze and have a moment to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Dylan is still single.&rdquo; Sarah suggested. &ldquo;I can still set you up with him. You don&rsquo;t even have to leave Nolan right away, just go on a date and see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love him.&rdquo; Anthea muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come again?&rdquo; Sarah asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love Nolan, okay?&rdquo; Anthea lashed out. &ldquo;Always have, always will. I&rsquo;m not interesten in Dylan, Rob, or anyone else, so stop trying to get me to cheat on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, then!&rdquo; Sarah returned the yelling. &ldquo;You can stay with him, but I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up, kicked her chair to the side, and stormed past the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it to heart&hellip;&rdquo; Chloe added sheepishly. &ldquo;She just wants the best for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she thinks that.&rdquo; Anthea replied calmly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d be much happier if she supported my relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chloe let out a big sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait outside. I&rsquo;ll go get Sarah and we&rsquo;ll cover the bill.&rdquo;</p>
