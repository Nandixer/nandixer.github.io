		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I will also put an &ldquo;out of 5&rdquo; rating for each enhancements.
Keep in mind, this is not an absolute measure of the enhancement&rsquo;s strength, but rather how useful I find it throughout all levels of play.
For example, Penitence can be boring and weak, but it can be gamechanging for certain ultra fights.
Praxis deals really high damage, but there are not many scenarios where you couldn&rsquo;t clear some content without Praxis.
Some niche builds rely on Lacerate, while Elysium doubles the performance of some classes.</p>
<h1 id="weapons">Weapons</h1>
<h2 id="base-forge-weapon">Base Forge Weapon</h2>
<h2 id="pacerate">Pacerate</h2>
<h3 id="35">3/5</h3>
<p>Despite how early you unlock it, Lacerate is actually pretty good.
The hit chance debuff on the enemy helps classes that can&rsquo;t otherwise reach maximum <strong>dodge</strong>.</p>
<p>Lacerate works wekk with classes that spam their 2-skill, which happens to be the case for most <strong>Calendar classes</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="smite">Smite</h2>
<h3 id="35-1">3/5</h3>
<p>Smite works really well on a few classes who come with a high damage boost and a cooldown on their 5-skill of 15 seconds.
To name a few, <strong>Void Highlord</strong>, <strong>LightCaster</strong>, and <strong>ShadowStalker of Time</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="praxis">Praxis</h2>
<h3 id="25">2/5</h3>
<p>Praxis has some for-fun builds making use of its Spinning Dragon.
It&rsquo;s also a source of growing DPS for <strong>long fights</strong> such as Ultra Speaker.</p>
<p>Outside these uses though, it&rsquo;s nothing exceptional.</p>
<h2 id="valiance">Valiance</h2>
<h3 id="55">5/5</h3>
<p>Valiance is really good.
Really, really good.
There is no class in the game that doesn&rsquo;t benefit from a massive boost to its base stats.</p>
<p>While other enhancements can outperform Valiance in a case-by-case basis, Valiance will always be one of the top 3 options for <strong>all classes</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="arcanas-concerto">Arcana&rsquo;s Concerto</h2>
<h3 id="45">4/5</h3>
<p>Arcana takes a while to stack, but increases the <em>physical and magical</em> damage taken by whoever you hit.
This is not the same as <em>all damage taken</em> - it stacks multiplicatively with other damage boosts.</p>
<p>Arcana is great for <strong>ultra fights</strong>, taken by whoever applies it best, typically <strong>Legion Revenant</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="acheron">Acheron</h2>
<h3 id="35-2">3/5</h3>
<h2 id="elysium">Elysium</h2>
<h3 id="45-1">4/5</h3>
<p>Elysium does not make already good classes better.
Elysium makes bad classes good.</p>
<p>For example, it&rsquo;s not particularly useful to take Elysium on Legion Revenant, because you already have plenty of mana without it.
You won&rsquo;t benefit for Elysium&rsquo;s mana recovery, and it&rsquo;ll deal reduced damage, too.</p>
<p>For contrast, <strong>Royal BattleMage</strong> and <strong>ArchMage</strong> can drain their mana efficiently, resulting in top-tier farming.
<strong>Ultra OmniKnight</strong> also benefits a lot from Elyisum.</p>
<h2 id="dauntless">Dauntless</h2>
<h3 id="55-1">5/5</h3>
<p>Dauntless is awesome for all classes that already play around with low health, such as <strong>Dark Metal Necro</strong>, <strong>Exalted Harbinger</strong>, or even <strong>Void HighLord</strong>.</p>
<p>Its one drawback is that it offers Strength and Endurance as stats rather than Luck.
But it easily makes up for this drawback with its boost to Haste and Crit Chance.</p>
<p>Just like Lacerate, Dauntless works well with <strong>Chronomancers</strong>, since you need to use your 2-skill to apply it.
The damage is even higher.</p>
<h1 id="helms">Helms</h1>
<h2 id="base-forge-helm">Base Forge Helm</h2>
<h3 id="35-3">3/5</h3>
<p>Despite it being a basic enhancement with no unique effect, Base Forge is actually a great alternative to Luck because it gives a little more primary stats (Strength and Intellect as opposed to Dexterity and Wisdom).</p>
<p>Base Forge also doesn&rsquo;t have the HP drawback of the other helmets.
You can use it even for ultra fights.</p>
<h2 id="vim">Vim</h2>
<h3 id="45-2">4/5</h3>
<p>Vim is awesome for <strong>dodge</strong> classes, but it also gives plenty of Luck to <strong>crit-based</strong> classes, such as <strong>Void Highlord</strong>, <strong>ShadowStalker of Time</strong>, or even unintuitive options like ArchPaladin.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use Vim on magical classes, and never use a Forge helmet for ultras.</p>
<h2 id="examen">Examen</h2>
<h3 id="15">1/5</h3>
<p>Very few classes benefit from high Wisdom. Examen is not that good.</p>
<h2 id="anima">Anima</h2>
<h3 id="35-4">3/5</h3>
<p>Anima is for <strong>physical</strong> classes such as <strong>Chaos Avenger</strong>, or <strong>Exalted Harbinger</strong>.
Keep in mind to test it on a class-by-class basis, because Vim might outperform it due to the Luck it gives.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use for Ultras - HP drawback.</p>
<h2 id="pneuma">Pneuma</h2>
<h3 id="45-3">4/5</h3>
<p>Very strong option for <strong>magical</strong> classes, especially if they rely on noncrits for damage, but even for crit-reliant magical classes, Pneuma is worth it.</p>
<p>Typical Pneuma users would be <strong>Legion Revenant</strong> (but not for ultras), <strong>ArchMage</strong>, or <strong>Blaze Binder</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="capes">Capes</h1>
<h2 id="base-forge-cape">Base Forge Cape</h2>
<h2 id="absolution">Absolution</h2>
<h3 id="25-1">2/5</h3>
<p>Absolution can be used by classes who heal, but don&rsquo;t heal so much that they already outheal the party without Absolution&rsquo;s assistance.</p>
<p><strong>StoneCrusher</strong> and <strong>Lord of Order</strong> are good Absolution users.</p>
<p>That said, in the situations where you want to use Absolution, you might need Penitence instead.</p>
<h2 id="vainglory">Vainglory</h2>
<h3 id="55-2">5/5</h3>
<p>Vainglory is the &ldquo;equip and forget&rdquo; enhancement of Forge capes.
The healing downside doesn&rsquo;t really come into play outside of hard bosses and ultras, meaning you can just benefit from the 15% damage boost in general gameplay.</p>
<p>Works well for <strong>all classes</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="avarice">Avarice</h2>
<h3 id="25-2">2/5</h3>
<p>The defense debuffs are pretty bad for Avarice, but getting from 40% to 50% Haste is a massive boost in damage.
Mainly used by <strong>farming classes</strong> who can&rsquo;t otherwise max their Haste.</p>
<h2 id="penitence">Penitence</h2>
<h3 id="55-3">5/5</h3>
<p>Penitence is anywhere from &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; to &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; for <strong>ultra fights</strong>.
Little utility outside of them, but that doesn&rsquo;t make Penitence any less of a gamechanger for fights like Ultra Speaker.</p>
<h2 id="lament">Lament</h2>
<h3 id="35-5">3/5</h3>
<p>Lament is good for classes that <strong>already have too much haste</strong>, or just don&rsquo;t care about it.
Typical classes who benefit from the extra crit chance are <strong>Calendar classes</strong>, to make sure that your nuke crits.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t really need Lament if you use Dauntless though.</p>
