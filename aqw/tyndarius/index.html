		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Tyndarius, the Avatar of Fire at <code>/join ultratyndarius</code> is a good entry-level Ultra and the first one I&rsquo;d recommend clearing after the three in TimeInn.
His Insignias offer <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/infernal-flame-pyromancer">Infernal Flame Pyromancer</a>, an armor with a 25% <a href="../boost-items">boost</a> to all rewards and 35% to damage.
<a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/infernal-flame-khopesh">Infernal Flame Khopesh</a>, also from Tyndarius, offerst the best damage boost to Elementals.
Clearing Tyndarius also unlocks further endgame content.</p>
<p>Worth mentioning that Tyndarius is a daily Ultra, not a weekly one.
Luckily, he&rsquo;s generally beatable in a minute or two with a well-prepared team.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-prepare">What To Prepare</h1>
<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>
<p>The classes to bring are <strong>ArchPaladin</strong>, <strong>Lord of Order</strong>, <strong>Legion Revenant</strong>, and one DPS role. The best DPS classes are Dragon of Time and Chaos Avenger, but alternatives like ShadowStalker of Time are also viable.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<p>Bring an item with a 51% damage boost like NSoD, if you can.</p>
<h2 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h2>
<p>Use the Enhancements you would naturally use on your class. Do not use Forge helms that reduce your health. Optionally, bring Penitence.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ArchPaladin</strong>: Full Luck, Valiance or Spiral Carve</li>
<li><strong>Lord of Order</strong>: Full Luck, Valiance or Smite</li>
<li><strong>Legion Revenant</strong>: Full Wizard, Valiance or Awe Blast</li>
<li><strong>Dragon of Time</strong>: Full Healer, Valiance or Awe Blast</li>
<li><strong>Chaos Avenger</strong>: Full Luck, Valiance or Arcana&rsquo;s Concerto</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, it&rsquo;s good to have exactly one Blast and Arcana per team, but it&rsquo;s not mandatory.</p>
<h2 id="potions">Potions</h2>
<p>Tonics and Elixirs are entirely optional for this fight and shouldn&rsquo;t be needed at max level.</p>
<p>What is mandatory is <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/scroll-of-enrage">Taunt Scrolls</a> though for everyone except the Lord of Order.</p>
<h1 id="tyndarius-explained">Tyndarius Explained</h1>
<p>Tyndarius is accompanied by two Orbs.
The main boss is stronger, but the orbs can scale their combat power indefinitely.
Almost all attacks are <abbr title="Area of Effect, hits multiple targets">AoE</abbr>, but they can be taunted.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to pay attention to any of the voice lines or abilities, because the strategy deals with all of them.</p>
<h1 id="strategy">Strategy</h1>
<p>The strategy is rather simple: 3 enemies, 3 taunters. It&rsquo;s not a problem if the taunts are not looped perfectly, you just need to make sure to taunt your designated target on cooldown.</p>
<p>To start the fight, stand near the entrance, tell your team you&rsquo;re ready, and apply your buffs. The ArchPaladin should go in first, and everyone should follow right after.</p>
<p>The ArchPaladin is the tankiest one, so it&rsquo;s their job to taunt Tyndarius himself.</p>
<p>The Legion Revenant and the DPS role will taunt the two orbs. It&rsquo;s best to agree which of them goes left, and which of them goes right before the fight. If your target dies, help killing the other orb, or attack Tyndarius.</p>
<p>The Lord of Order doesn&rsquo;t need to taunt anything, so they can just his the boss and loop their damage spells.</p>
<p>If the Orbs respawn, the same player who taunted them first should go back to them. Repeat until Tyndarius is dead.</p>
