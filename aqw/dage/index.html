		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Dage the Dark Lord is the head of the Undead Legion and one of the more unconventional Ultra fights in the game.
He can be found at <code>/join ultradage</code>.</p>
<p>His Insignias can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>to act as a shortcut to unlock <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/legion-revenant-class">Legion Revenant</a>.</li>
<li>to get 51% boost weapons such as <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/necrotic-blade-of-the-underworld">Necrotic Blade of the Underworld</a></li>
<li>for the 50% to Undead boost of <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/empowered-undead-champion">Empowered Undead Champion</a></li>
<li>and for items with 35% damage boost to all monsters on top of a 25% Gold/XP/REP/CP boost.
<ul>
<li>Notably, <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/empowered-bonfire-altar">Empowered Bonfire Altar</a> does this in the cape slot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important thing to know about Dage is that he applies <strong>Noxious Decay</strong>, which turns all Player Healing into damage. More on this later.</p>
<h1 id="what-to-prepare">What to Prepare</h1>
<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>
<h3 id="legion-doomknight">Legion DoomKnight</h3>
<p>Despite no longer being at the top of the foodchain, Legion DoomKnight actually shines in the Dage fight.
It has its own Lifesteal effect on its 3-skill, as well as a loopable Decay skill and other debuffs.</p>
<p>You should always have a LDK in your team.</p>
<h3 id="chaos-avenger">Chaos Avenger</h3>
<p>Great damage, great debuffs, built-in lifesteal, and extreme tankiness.
CAv doesn&rsquo;t offer a decay, but otherwise it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
<p>CAv is really, really good for Dage.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-chronomancer">Quantum Chronomancer</h3>
<p>One of two Chrono classes viable for Ultras, but the other one is useless without its healing.</p>
<p>QCM has great damage and some buffs to make the fight go faster.</p>
<h2 id="problem-classes">Problem Classes</h2>
<p>You might notice a pattern here: these are really good classes for Ultras.
The one problem with them is that they all have some sort of healing built in.
You still can and should use them, but you need to avoid pressing the healing skill, unless you want to wipe your team.</p>
<p>They are still good, you just need to not heal.</p>
<h3 id="lord-of-order">Lord of Order</h3>
<p>The best support class in the game.
I recommend running a LoO in most team compositions.
Your healing skill is 3 - do not use it.</p>
<h3 id="archpaladin">ArchPaladin</h3>
<p>Best defensive support in the game.
Your healing skill is 3 - do not use it.</p>
<h3 id="legion-revenant">Legion Revenant</h3>
<p>Best offensive support in the game.
Not always ran because you can&rsquo;t use your 4 - skill as it heals you.</p>
<p>There is a trick with LR:
Enter PvP with an ArchPaladin, have them use 4 on you.</p>
<p>This will reduce your HoT from 4 by 90%. Due to how HoTs work, this decrease will stay even after the debuff from AP expires. Absolution makes this even more effective.</p>
<p>Keep this reduced HoT looped and you&rsquo;re free to run LR to your heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>
<p><strong>Dage is not an Undead</strong>.
Use <strong>NSoD</strong> variants (51% to all boost), <em>not</em> BLoD variants (75% to Undead).</p>
<h2 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h2>
<p><strong>Vainglory</strong> has no downside because you can&rsquo;t heal anyway, so use it on all classes.
Other than that, use your class&rsquo; usual enhancements. Penitence is also great if you need the defense.</p>
<p>One important thing: <strong>Health Vamp</strong>.
Unless your class has a built-in Lifesteal, you need to run Health Vamp to keep your health up.</p>
<p>If you have <strong>Dauntless</strong>, you should use it instead.
But if you&rsquo;ve got it, you don&rsquo;t need my help for Dage.</p>
<h2 id="potions">Potions</h2>
<p>Dage actually doesn&rsquo;t hit exceptionally hard.
Because of this, Tonics and Elixirs are generally not required unless you&rsquo;re under-leveled.</p>
<p>What is recommended though is <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/scroll-of-life-steal">Scrolls of Life Steal</a>. Use them on cooldown to keep your health up during the fight.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a Legion DoomKnight, <a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/scroll-of-decay">Scrolls of Decay</a> might be necessary by at least one person (preferably by someone who has lifesteal built into their class).</p>
<p><a href="http://aqwwiki.wikidot.com/scroll-of-enrage">Scrolls of Enrage</a> can be used to taunt Dage, particularly during his Legion Mages skill, or in general to keep your team alive. This is optional.</p>
<h1 id="strategy">Strategy</h1>
<h2 id="soul-eater">Soul Eater</h2>
<p>Do not die in the Dage fight.
If you die, he heals for half a million HP.
<em>This is not Decayable.</em>
Dage will keep getting stronger the longer you take and the more you die to him.
Unless he&rsquo;s low on health, I recommend resetting the fight after 4-5 deaths.</p>
<h2 id="noxious-decay">Noxious Decay</h2>
<p>Dage applies a debuff that turns all healing into damage.
This is why we need to take different classes for the Dage fight, and why we need to avoid healing spells.</p>
<ul>
<li>direct Healing (for example ArchPaladin&rsquo;s 3 skill) <strong>will damage you</strong></li>
<li>Healing over Time (such as StoneCrusher&rsquo;s 4 skill) <strong>will damage you</strong></li>
<li>Life Steal (for example LDK&rsquo;s 3 skill) heals you as normal
<ul>
<li>an easy way to tell what&rsquo;s a Life Steal: if you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> see a green number above you, it&rsquo;s a Life Steal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if you have Dauntless: Noxious Decay is irrelevant because all your healing is 0
<ul>
<li>Life Steal (including Dauntless&rsquo; own) will work as normal</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Noxious Decay is applied throughout the whole fight with the exception of one brief moment.</p>
<p><img src="/img/aqw/dage2.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Dage stops attacking while he&rsquo;s using his Mages.
You can technically heal when Noxious Decay has expired.</p>
<h2 id="zones">Zones</h2>
<p><img src="/img/aqw/dage1.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>If you fought Chaos Lord Ledgermayne, you must be familiar with this move.
One of the two &ldquo;portals&rdquo; light up, and you need to walk there.
You need to be reasonably quick - Dage is faster than Ledgermayne.</p>
<p>I recommend hiding players and chat to make it easier to see the platforms and click on them.</p>
<p>Dage uses this skill 3 times before using the Mages.</p>
<h2 id="mages">Mages</h2>
<p>Dage begins charging for 10 seconds.
During this time, he also heals himself.
<strong>This healing can and should be Decayed by either LDK or a Decay Scroll.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea for CAv or LDK to Taunt the damage itself.
A good timing for this is to press taunt as soon as the yellow warning text fades.</p>
<p>After this skill, Dage will continue using the Zones skill.</p>
