		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Chronomancers, also known as Calendar classes, can be obtained for 6000 ACs or 5 HeroPoints at <code>/join heromart</code>.
Alternatively, you can physically order the more recent calendars and get a code alongside them to unlock the class.</p>
<p>Calendar classes are known for their Rift Collapse mechanic, which lets them take the damage they&rsquo;ve dealt in the last 10 seconds, multiply it by some factor, and deal it all again in one huge crit: a nuke.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, some monsters, ultra bosses in particular, have a Boss Shield on them that prevents Rift Collapse from oneshotting them.
Despite this, some Chronos still perform really well in ultra fights.
Not to mention the fact that 99% of monsters in the game have no such shields.</p>
<p>When selecting a Chronomancer, you should consider if it&rsquo;s your first Chrono or not, what you want to use it for, and how much high-skill content you like dealing with.</p>
<h1 id="chronos">Chronos</h1>
<h2 id="2011-chronomancer--chronomancer-prime">2011 Chronomancer / Chronomancer Prime</h2>
<p>The original Chronomancer is actually still a great pick, especially for a first Chrono.</p>
<p>You get a short cooldown, reliable nuke, and a fast way to get Temporal Rift stacks.
CMP also represents the essence of Calendar classes really well - the damage stacking into Rift Collapse mechanic.</p>
<p>One downside is that the class is incredibly boring and 2 of its 4 skills are essentially useless.</p>
<p>Its main use case is chainkilling bosses in a team.
For all other scenarios, other Chronos beat it.
That said, you&rsquo;ll likely get the fastest kills with this one.</p>
<p><strong>Great first Chrono to get for farming bosses.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2012-chronocorruptor--chrono-chaorruptor">2012 ChronoCorruptor / Chrono Chaorruptor</h2>
<p>What can I say about ChronoCorruptor?
It tries to be a crit Chrono, it tries to be a DoT Chrono, and sort of just fails at both.</p>
<p>The nuke frequently noncrits if you can land it at all.</p>
<p>Yes, its performance can be improved with Elysium or Dauntless, but wouldn&rsquo;t you rather just use those enhancements on an already good class?</p>
<p><strong>Not recommended.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2013-timekeeper--timekiller">2013 TimeKeeper / TimeKiller</h2>
<p>I have to admit, I&rsquo;m partial against TimeKeeper because it directly competes with my two favorite classes (coming later in this list) as a dodge class.
TimeKeeper is rather easy to use, allowing for a mindless playstyle.</p>
<p>With the right enhancements, TimeKeeper can reach maximum dodge, making it ideal for solo play.
However, you can still bring the nuking aspect to group fights, albeit your crits aren&rsquo;t quite as high as alternatives.</p>
<p><strong>Great Chrono for general use and solo play.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2014-chronocommander--chronocommandant">2014 ChronoCommander / ChronoCommandant</h2>
<p>ChronoCommander is not bad actually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tanky, has a low cooldown nuke, and used to be used for some ultras.
These days, you would prefer QCM or PCM in a team, but that doesn&rsquo;t make CMD weak by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p><strong>I feel neutral on this. Get it if you like what it offers.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2015-chrono-dragonknight--chrono-dataknight">2015 Chrono DragonKnight / Chrono DataKnight</h2>
<p>A magic-based Chrono with no sustain abilities. Terrible for solo play.</p>
<p>That said, when buffed by a team, CDK offers huge crits, oneshotting nearly all bosses.</p>
<p>CDK has little utility as it overkills most bosses, while CMP&rsquo;s faster, but slightly weaker nukes would be enough.</p>
<p>That said, I can&rsquo;t deny the appeal of big orange numbers. Get it if you want high crits and don&rsquo;t care about anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Neither bad nor good. Get if you want big crits. Avoid if you&rsquo;re a solo player.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2016-infinity-knight--interstellar-knight">2016 Infinity Knight / Interstellar Knight</h2>
<p>This class is just bad.</p>
<p>The DoT has a longer cooldown than SSoT&rsquo;s nuke.
Of course Infinity Knight&rsquo;s DoT ticks three times as opposed to SSoT&rsquo;s two nukes&hellip; except Infinity Knight doesn&rsquo;t have a Rift mechanic, meaning it&rsquo;s just a regular old DoT.</p>
<p>Yes, you technically could use Arachnomancer to buff your damage over time, but same goes for SSoT.</p>
<p>Infinity Knight takes time to ramp up its damage and even then it&rsquo;s nothing exceptional.</p>
<p><strong>Not recommended.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2017-shadowwalker-of-time--shadowstalker-of-time">2017 ShadowWalker of Time / ShadowStalker of Time</h2>
<p>I love this class.</p>
<p>High damage, max dodge, and even some alternate uses for farming and PvP.</p>
<p>The combos and enhancements can be a bit complex, but nothing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pz34RQGUKOg">class guide</a> can&rsquo;t explain.</p>
<p><strong>Great general-use chrono if you don&rsquo;t mind learning its spell rotation. You will be happy with it.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2018-eternal-chronomancer--immortal-chronomancer">2018 Eternal Chronomancer / Immortal Chronomancer</h2>
<p>Would you like a physical CDK with some self-sustain and a higher <abbr title="The factor by which you multiply your damage when nuking">Rift Multiplier</abbr>?</p>
<p>Immortal Chronomancer has an easy, but lengthy combo, which sets up a massive nuke.</p>
<p>Suffers from the same drawback as CDK where it overkills most enemies.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/px15ch3EVDI">highest hitting</a> Calendar class in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Neither bad nor good. Get if you want big crits.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2019-corrupted-chronomancer--timeless-chronomancer">2019 Corrupted Chronomancer / Timeless Chronomancer</h2>
<p>Once you learn this class, you&rsquo;ll hardly ever use anything else for bossing.</p>
<p>Once I made my SSoT guide video, I banked that class to force myself to learn Corrupted.
Let me tell you, CCM hits like an absolute truck.</p>
<p>On top of that, you&rsquo;ve got access to max-dodge, great synergy with Dauntless, and the option to make the class even stronger with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fun2gOOcN8o&amp;t=80s">trickery</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid if you dislike learning complex classes. If you don&rsquo;t mind the difficulty, get this NOW.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2020-underworld-chronomancer--overworld-chronomancer">2020 Underworld Chronomancer / Overworld Chronomancer</h2>
<p>Underworld is a good class. Really.</p>
<p>But it fails to answer one question: why not get Timeless instead?</p>
<p>If you already have Underworld, by all means, use Underworld. But there are not many scenarios where you outperform Timeless.</p>
<p><strong>I recommend Timeless Chronomancer instead.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2021-nechronomancer--necrotic-chronomancer">2021 Nechronomancer / Necrotic Chronomancer</h2>
<p>This is not a Chronomancer.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Nechronomancer is an awesome farming class. You will be very happy to have it.</p>
<p>But you can get farming classes through free-to-play means, while Calendar classes normally offer something unique: the nukes.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid if you&rsquo;ve got ArchMage, Legion Revenant, or plan to get either.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2022-continuum-chronomancer--quantum-chronomancer">2022 Continuum Chronomancer / Quantum Chronomancer</h2>
<p>Designed to be a support chrono and good at its job.</p>
<p>Quantum Chronomancer performs really well in groups, and greatly speeds up ultra fights.</p>
<p>To compensate, its performance in solo play is quite lacking.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid if you don&rsquo;t do ultras.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2023-paladin-chronomancer">2023 Paladin Chronomancer</h2>
<p>Once again: not a Chronomancer.</p>
<p>Paladin Chronomancer doesn&rsquo;t nuke. If you need nukes, get something else.</p>
<p>If you need a healer, a tank, or a PvP&rsquo;er, then definitely get this class though, because it&rsquo;s absolutely top-tier in all of these categories.
Paladin Chronomancer is also useful in ultra fights, as a replacement to ArchPaladin.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid if you don&rsquo;t do ultras.</strong></p>
<h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>

<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s go over some example recommendations.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Just pick one for me!&rdquo; → <strong>TimeKeeper</strong></li>
<li>&ldquo;I want to farm bosses with my friends as fast as possible.&rdquo; → <strong>Chronomancer</strong></li>
<li>&ldquo;I want something that&rsquo;s good in all situations, I never want to unequip it.&rdquo; → <strong>ShadowStalker of Time</strong></li>
<li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a solo player and I want to kill bosses as fast as possible, including hard-hitting ones. I have time to master it.&rdquo; → <strong>Timeless Chronomancer</strong></li>
</ul>
