		<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Alright, this guide will be pointlessly complicated AND pointlessly specific.</p>
<p>Are you in the 1% of players that care about a difference between <code>22k</code> and <code>24k</code> DPS when farming on ArchMage?</p>
<p>And if you are, do you happen to be in the other 1% to have wasted <abbr title="The 40,000 ACs package will give you a 68% chance of opening Acheron">$100</abbr> on Acheron?</p>
<h1 id="mechanics">Mechanics</h1>
<h2 id="acheron">Acheron</h2>
<p>Acheron, when used, applies a DoT to the user.
This stacks up to 30x for about <code>~1500</code>, depending on the active buffs.</p>
<p>You can let this DoT fade, but to do so, you have to pay attention.
You also need to temporarily stop using your 3, reducing DPS.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can just outheal the DoT. ArchMage&rsquo;s Corporeal mode in particular is great for this.</p>
<h2 id="hot-squaring">HoT Squaring</h2>
<p>A little-known mechanic in AQW is that if you have a <em>Damage Out</em> boost active <strong>when you apply an HoT</strong>, the HoT will be stronger even after the original <em>Damage Out</em> boost fades.</p>
<p>By Damage Out boost, I mean this stat:
<img src="/img/ae1f759c-e918-48ea-852e-0b911f108f30.png" alt="asd"></p>
<p>This is called squaring because the HoT is multiplied ty the boost at the time of healing too. It&rsquo;s multiplied twice, so multiplied by the boost <em>squared</em>.</p>
<p>This also works for DoTs, but we care about HoTs here.</p>
<h2 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h2>
<p>We care about the cape slot here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Penitence</strong> increases our defenses and decreases our DoTs, including self-DoT. It&rsquo;s almost always used alongside Acheron.</li>
<li><strong>Lament</strong> and equivalents are neutral for our damage output and survivability. ArchMage can outheal the Acheron DoT without Penitence, most other classes cannot.</li>
<li><strong>Vainglory</strong> offers a boost to our damage output, but halves our healing. This means we can&rsquo;t heal enough to counteract the self-DoT&hellip; or can we?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-plan">The Plan</h1>
<p>Very simple.
We get our Corporeal HoT so high that it outheals the fully-stacked Acheron DoT <em>despite Vainglory</em>.
We take advantage of HoT squaring to achieve this.
This way we can have our cake and eat it too.</p>
<p>As an added benefit, the DoT will keep our health low for the purposes of our 4 skill.

<p>Now how do we achieve this?</p>
<h2 id="double-potion">Double Potion</h2>
<p>Did you know, Potent Honor potions have a cooldown of 60s (that&rsquo;s 30s at max haste), and a duration of 35s?
This means that you have a 5 second window to use a second potion.
The best option here is Dark Potion - the one you get from the secret Dark Box quest.</p>
<p>If you have Acheron, you have Dark Potions too.
But if you want a high HoT for a different purpose, you can substitute regular Honor Potions.</p>
<h2 id="elysium-into-acheron">Elysium into Acheron</h2>
<p>Another pointlessly complicated trick.
Elysium gives you a 10% damage boost, Acheron a 30%.
However, Elysium&rsquo;s boost lasts long enough for you to exit combat, switch to Acheron, and finish applying your HoT.</p>
<h2 id="5-3-3-5">5-3-3-5</h2>
<p>5-3-5 is the standard way of applying your Corporeal HoT.
It keeps your Mana maxed, and you benefit from the <code>30%</code> damage buff from your 5-skill.
You use <code>3</code> twice - once to apply Elysium, once to apply Acheron.</p>
<h2 id="missing-link">Missing Link</h2>
<p>As it turns out, even with all the above tricks combined, we can&rsquo;t outheal Acheron-Vainglory.
We need to get our HoT higher still.
We have a few options to finish the setup.
Any one of the below will work:</p>
<h3 id="divine-elixir">Divine Elixir</h3>
<p>Fairly easy to get, increases our healing.
Needs to be reapplied every 15 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="revitalize-elixir">Revitalize Elixir</h3>
<p>From Alchemy, gives us an additional HoT.
Needs to be reapplied every 15 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="lord-of-order">Lord of Order</h3>
<p>Have a friend use LoO&rsquo;s <code>3</code> skill for a <code>30%</code> damage boost.
Optionally, they can also use <code>4</code> when applying the combo to give you a bit of extra haste.
Only needed once to set up.</p>
<h3 id="legion-revenant">Legion Revenant</h3>
<p>Similar to Lord of Order, use <code>4</code>.
Only needed once to set up.</p>
<h1 id="execute">Execute</h1>
<h2 id="gear">Gear</h2>
<p>Making sure you&rsquo;re wearing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weapon: <strong>Elysium</strong>, with <strong>Acheron</strong> in your inventory</li>
<li>Class: <strong>Wizard</strong></li>
<li>Helm: <strong>Pneuma</strong></li>
<li>Cape: <strong>Vainglory</strong></li>
<li>Potion: <strong>Potent Honor</strong>, with <strong>Dark Potion</strong> in your inventory</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="combo">Combo</h2>
<ul>
<li>use Potent Honor Potion</li>
<li>switch to Dark Potion as you wait for it to cool down</li>
<li>if using a friend, have them spam their buff skill continuously</li>
<li>wait until the potion cooldown is around 7 to 5 seconds depending on lag</li>
<li>use 5-3</li>
<li>leave combat</li>
<li>switch to Acheron</li>
<li>use Dark Potion</li>
<li>return to combat</li>
<li>use 3-5</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="result">Result</h2>
<p>You should see an HoT tick of <code>2100</code> if you executed the combo properly.
The next tick should be <code>2011</code> as Elysium fades.
Then, lower as Potent Honor, Arcana Sigil, Dark Potion, your friend&rsquo;s buff, and Acheron each fade.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, the DoT will get high again when you return to combat.</p>
<p>In my testing, a well-executed HoT of <code>1526</code> will just about outheal the max-stack <code>1516</code> DoT.</p>
